      0.2.10 introduces LAN support for services running on the Embassy. A service's LAN address (.local URL) can be accessed while connected to the same network.
      This is useful for two reasons: (1) LAN connections are significantly faster than Tor, and (2) if the Tor network is experiencing connectivity issues, you will not be locked out of your services.

      It also introduces support for services to define one-time actions that are exposed to the user. This
      can be useful for password resets or other types of operations where doing it through the service UI would be
      insecure or otherwise undesirable.
